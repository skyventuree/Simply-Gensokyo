# Custom dancer
Dancer is a feature (currently) exclusive to Simply Gensokyo that will add a character to the gameplay. This is NOT the same feature as Stepmania's background 3D character.

## Preparing your character
You must prepare an animation sheet of such character you want to add and name their file corresponding to the directory name, with the frame width, height and "(doubleres)" if your character can be added with double the resolution.

For example, if your character has a sheet of 14 x 2 and named "NMReimu", you must name them and put them in the folder like this: `NMReimu 14x2 (doubleres).png`.

Failed to do so may break the theme entirely.

## Adding to your game
After the preparation, drag the file of your character to the `Dancers` folder in the theme directory and they should be in the player options menu!
