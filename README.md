# Simply Gensokyo v0.1 for ITGMania
A heavily modified Simply Love SM5 theme with Touhou stuff in it. I made this theme just to have some cool danmaku girls in the background while dancing. This theme is not intended for public use. 

Only the visuals and audios are modified. Scoring and any mostly other stuff will remain the same like the original Simply Love.

Original SLSM5: https://github.com/Simply-Love/Simply-Love-SM5

# Added
- BGAs for title screen. (See attribution.txt for a list of links lead to the original artworks and resources.)
- New Combo font: DF POPコン W12 (Windows Era TH Font)
- Small character dancing during gameplay. (with the ability to add custom characters)

# Modified/Removed
- UI and English strings are modified. Other languages are remains untouched.
- Default to load Touhou related stuff.
- Removed all visual style (including Heart and SRPG).
- Removed rainbow mode.

## Work in Progress
- Touhou look-a-like title screen.
- New logo for the theme.
- PC-98 combo font.
- Ability Card as for Select color screen. (idk how to work on this :/)

# Install
Download and put this theme in `Themes/` folder in your game directory.

Migrate to `Save/` and open `ThemePrefs.ini`, duplicate your old `[Simply Love]` entries and rename them as `[Simply Gensokyo]`.

Your profile preferences and data will remain the same as you were using the original Simply Love theme.

# Compatibility
Only ITGMania has full support including GrooveStats. Other Simply Love compatible Stepmania games do not have proper GrooveStats launcher integration and require you to turn it off or port the GS helper file from your working SL theme.

You can port `Scripts/SL-Helpers-GrooveStats.lua` from your working Simply Love instance to Simply Gensokyo if you want to use GrooveStats launcher with this theme.

*(I have not tested this. I also do not know if there are actually more stuff that is exclusive to ITGMania, mainly network support. I won't fix this issue.)*
